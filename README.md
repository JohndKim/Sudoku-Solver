# Sudoku-Solver
Randomly generates a sudoku and allows the player to attempt to solve it or have the backtracking algorithm solve it.


HOW TO ENTER A VALUE

The player can enter a value into an empty cell by clicking on it, entering a number 1-9, and pressing enter.
If it is the correct value, then the number is accepted and can't be changed, else the cell returns to being empty.
The player doesn't have to submit a value and can simply leave a temporary value in the cell to later submit.
